    "aboutme": "Hello, world! My name is Matheus Pizani. I'm a 5th-semester Computer Science student with a strong passion for web development. I enjoy working on both front-end and back-end — yep, I'm fullstack! I love challenges and I'm always looking to learn something new, whether it's a technology, a tool, or a different way to solve problems. I truly believe technology can turn ideas into amazing experiences — and that's exactly what keeps me motivated to keep coding every single day."
